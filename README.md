Homework for Academic Writing, Norms, and Ethics

### Solution
1. - **Plagiarism:**  The failure to acknowledge ideas, research, or language taken from others, whether intentional or unintentional. <br> 
    -  **Multiple submission:** Submitting works that are almost identical(e.g. no difference in proposed framework or exactly same experimental results) to two or more conferences/journals simultaneously; Submitting work from one course for a grade or credit in another, without first obtaining express written permission from both course instructors.
2. Schon is a German physicist in the field of semiconductor and organic transistor, whose breakthroughs were found out to be fraudulent([reference report](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~kalas/ethics/documents/schoen.pdf)). The involved academic misconducts include: data substitution(e.g. for laser emission spectrum), unrealistic precision(e.g. for characterization of sputtering process), contradictory physics(e.g. unipolar inverter characteristics).
